## About
I am currently a Software Engineer II at Microsoft, working on the Azure DevOps team. I enjoy building modern UI experiences using the latest and greatest in web technologies, including React and Redux.

I started my journey in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science in December 2015. In pursuing my degree, I've concentrated on system architecture and computer networking. Additionally, I served as President of GITMAD, the mobile application club on campus. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy trying my hand at <a href="http://500px.com/alexbettadapur" target="_blank">photography</a>, working on my <a href="http://github.com/abettadapur/RuseServer" target="_blank">personal music player</a>, trying hard to learn more Chinese and playing jazz on the saxophone.
