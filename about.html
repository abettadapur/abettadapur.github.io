## About
I am an experienced front-end developer who enjoys building modern UI experiences using the latest and greatest in web technologies. I frequently leverage the React and Redux ecosystems, and have even contributed back to them with a couple of open source projects. 

Currently, I work at Microsoft on the Azure DevOps team, where we build best in class Agile tools. Previously, I worked on the Microsoft Project team, where I helped to modernize their engineering stack.

I started my journey in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science in December 2015. In pursuing my degree, I've concentrated on system architecture and computer networking. Additionally, I served as President of GITMAD, the mobile application club on campus. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy trying my hand at <a href="http://500px.com/alexbettadapur" target="_blank">photography</a>, working on my <a href="http://github.com/abettadapur/RuseServer" target="_blank">personal music player</a>, trying hard to learn more Chinese and playing jazz on the saxophone.
