## About
I am currently a junior software developer at Microsoft in Seattle, working on the Microsoft Project team.

I started my journey in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science in December 2015. In pursuing my degree, I've concentrated on system architecture and computer networking. Additionally, I served as President of GITMAD, the mobile application club on campus. 

I've also completed three software development internships. In 2013, I worked at IgnitionOne, a digital marketing firm, on the DevOps team where I configured the <a href="https://hubot.github.com" target="_blank">Hubot</a> chatbot and helped set up a new continuous integration system using <a href="http://octopusdeploy.com" target="_blank">OctopusDeploy</a>. In 2014, I worked at Rackspace Hosting on the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Zaqar" target="_blank">Openstack Marconi (now Zaqar)</a> project and implementing a RabbitMQ cluster orchestration system. In 2015, I was at Microsoft in Seattle on the <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/project/enterprise-project-server" target="_blank">Project Server</a> team where I was able to work with a huge .NET codebase and SQL Server. Most recently, I worked at an Atlanta based cloud startup, <a href="http://www.cirrity.com" target="_blank">Cirrity</a>, where I worked on their new ASP.NET MVC customer portal.


When I'm not working, I enjoy trying my hand at <a href="http://500px.com/alexbettadapur" target="_blank">photography</a>, working on my <a href="http://github.com/abettadapur/RuseServer" target="_blank">personal music player</a>, trying hard to learn more Chinese and playing jazz on the saxophone.
